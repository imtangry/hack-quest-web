Together, this program seeks to equip students to understand the challenges and opportunities of ideating and building a startup in web3 and getting hands-on experience.",

As decentralized technologies mature into the building blocks for open metaverse economies, smart contract platforms raised over $50 billion in 2022 alone. New unicorn projects now launch monthly across NFTs, digital identity, tokenized fan engagement, governance design, and composable DeFi.",
      "text2": " With web3 inhabiting the cutting edge, immense opportunities await those armed with the right applied blockchain skillsets and community-centric mindsets. Through exposure to successful entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists, as well as an overview of open challenges in the industry, we hope to equip those seeking to conceive and actualize ventures natively built for user ownership."
