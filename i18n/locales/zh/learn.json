Users are here too. More than half a billion people had become cryptocurrency users or owners by the end of 2023, according to cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com.",
      "text3": "For founders and aspiring founders in Web3, now is the time to build. This MOOC is designed to guide founders and aspiring founders through ideating and building Web3 projects under the mentorship of leading founders, investors, and researchers from both industry and academia. We hope to equip students with the knowledge and confidence to articulate the potential of Web3 technology, develop innovative Web3 project ideas, build and deploy basic Web3 applications, and navigate the evolving Web3 landscape. This course is your gateway into the world of Web3. Get ready to learn, build, and become a part of the future!"
