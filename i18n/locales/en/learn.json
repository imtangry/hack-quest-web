As decentralized technologies mature into the building blocks for open metaverse economies, smart contract platforms raised over $50 billion in 2022 alone. New unicorn projects now launch monthly across NFTs, digital identity, tokenized fan engagement, governance design, and composable DeFi.",

Through exposure to successful entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists, as well as an overview of open challenges in the industry, we hope to equip those seeking to conceive and actualize ventures natively built for user ownership."
